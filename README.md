# High Performance PostgreSQL for Rails: A Workbook

This repository is my personal workbook and study guide for the book ["High Performance PostgreSQL for Rails"](https://pragprog.com/titles/aapsql/high-performance-postgresql-for-rails/) by Andrew Atkinson. It contains my notes, solutions to exercises, and a glossary of key terms.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are:
* To deeply understand and apply advanced PostgreSQL concepts within a Rails environment.
* To document my learning process for future reference and reinforcement.
* To create a portfolio piece that demonstrates my skills in database optimization and performance tuning.

## ðŸ’» Companion Project: Rideshare App

The concepts and optimizations from this workbook were applied to a practical Ruby on Rails project. You can view the live application and its source code here:
